# DeathStacksBot
## University homework. A Haskell-written Bot able to play death stacks.

[About DeathStacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Stacks)

Our task was only to implement two functions in DeathStacksBot.hs:

* listMoves-function delivers all the possible moves in current situation in form of a string 
(format of the string was defined in the homework-assignment sheet). Different moves with the same amount of steps
and with the same start and end point will not appear as options.
* getMove-function chooses one of the options in current situation. Due to the fact that implementation of this function
was not important for the final note and we were really lazy and had to prepare ourselfs to other exampls, our function
simply tooks the first of the possible steps :D

This bot is able to play in the game DeathStacks that we implemented in another [assignment](https://github.com/kostjaigin/DeathStacks)
